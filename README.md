# QuizLLMproject2
Repo for my LLM analysis task - project 2 - IITM - Data Science and Applications

This project is a local quiz/assignment solver that runs entirely on your machine using FastAPI and a Groq LLM–powered universal solver.
I exposed my server using ngrok, so no deployment (Railway/Render) is required.
